## **SmartPay API Documentation**

# SmartPay API â€“ Overview

### Introduction

The **SmartPay API** enables developers to integrate secure and seamless digital payments into their applications. With SmartPay, businesses can accept payments globally, verify transactions, issue refunds, and manage real-time payment data, all through a simple REST interface.

SmartPay is built with **speed**, **security**, and **developer experience** in mind, offering predictable JSON responses, easy authentication, and clear documentation inspired by PayPal and Stripe.

**Fictional API Notice**
> The SmartPay API is a **fictional/sample** payments API created for learning, documentation practice, and portfolio demonstration purposes only.  
> It is **not** a live payment processor and does **not** process real payments. Any example keys, webhooks, transaction IDs, or sandbox endpoints in this documentation are illustrative. Do **not** use this API for real financial transactions. For production payment integrations, consult a licensed payment provider such as Stripe, PayPal, or Flutterwave.
