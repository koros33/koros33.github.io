# Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome to my cybersecurity projects portfolio.  
I’m passionate about analyzing threats, understanding attacker behavior, and building defensive tools that enhance system visibility and resilience.  
This section highlights some of my practical work in areas such as intrusion detection, log analysis, purple teaming, and password security.

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here
Each project reflects a key aspect of cybersecurity analysis  from detecting suspicious patterns to testing organizational defenses.

- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):**  
  My custom implementation and testing of a lightweight intrusion detection system for network monitoring.

- **Windows Log Parser:**  
  A parser that extracts and analyzes critical Windows Event Logs to detect anomalies and potential threats.

- **Purple Team Zero and Cyber Purple Team:**  
  Collaborative exercises combining red (offense) and blue (defense) strategies to improve detection and response capabilities, though still in prod phase.

- **Password Strength Checker:**  
  A tool to evaluate password robustness and guide users toward stronger, safer credentials.
