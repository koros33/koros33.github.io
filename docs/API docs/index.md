# API Documentation

Welcome to the **API Documentation Hub**.  
This section contains documentation I’ve written for two APIs as part of my technical writing portfolio:  

- **Weather API** 🌦️ — Based on the real [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), providing current weather, forecasts, and related data.  
- **Payments API** 💳 — A sample API I created to demonstrate how financial/payment systems could be documented.  


## 📚 What’s Included
For each API, the documentation is structured into:

- **Overview** — Introduction and key features.  
- **Authentication** — How to access the API.  
- **Endpoints** — Parameters, request examples, and responses.  
- **Errors** — Error codes and handling guidelines.  
- **Quickstart** — A simple step-by-step example to get started.  


## 🚀 Quick Links

- [Payments API Documentation](payments/index.md)  


## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Are these production APIs?**  
A: The **Weather API** is based on the real OpenWeather API. The **Payments API** is a **mock API**, created for documentation demonstration purposes.  

**Q: Can I test the APIs?**  
A: Yes — you can test the Weather API using your own OpenWeather API key. The Payments API examples are illustrative only.  

**Q: Why document them?**  
A: To showcase technical writing skills, including structuring docs, writing clear examples, and explaining authentication, endpoints, and error handling.
