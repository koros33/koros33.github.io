# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I’m Koros Ian , an aspiring **Cybersecurity Analyst** exploring the world of threat detection, log analysis, and red/blue/purple team exercises.  
This portfolio showcases hands-on projects where I combine **practical tools**, **analytical thinking**, and **security automation** to solve real-world problems.


## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. [Intrusion Detection System (IDS)](ids.md)
A **lightweight IDS prototype** built in Python that monitors network traffic, applies configurable rules, and generates real-time alerts.  
Highlights: rule-based detection, CLI workflow, packet sniffing, and modular design for security testing.

### 2. [Windows Log Parser & Threat Hunter](windows-log-parser.md)
Enterprise ready log analysis tool (`log_hunter.py`) for **SOC workflows**.  
Features: live log parsing, EVTX offline analysis, brute-force & privilege escalation detection, YARA & VirusTotal integration.

### 3. [Purple Team Zero](purple-team-zero.md)
A **production-ready purple-team framework** combining offensive emulation and defensive validation.  
Includes attack simulations, automated detection validation, and MITRE ATT&CK-aligned scenarios.

### 4. [Password Strength Checker](password-strength-checker.md)
A small but practical Python utility to **estimate password strength**, visualize entropy, and calculate brute-force attack time.  
Great for demonstrating risk analysis and explaining password security to end-users.

### 5. Parent-Child Process Threat Hunting Notebook__
Lightweight notebook showing how to detect suspicious parent–child process relationships using Windows event logs.


## 🧠 My Focus
- **Threat Detection & Response:** Building tools to identify and respond to attacks in real time.  
- **Log Analysis & SOC Workflows:** Parsing logs, generating actionable insights, and validating detections.  
- **Red & Blue Team Collaboration:** Simulating attacks safely while testing defenses.  
- **Practical Security Automation:** Writing Python scripts and frameworks that scale for analyst workflows.


## 📈 Why These Projects Matter
Each project in this portfolio demonstrates my ability to:
- Apply **analytical reasoning** to real security problems.  
- Combine **offensive thinking** with defensive engineering.  
- Communicate technical findings through **visuals, logs, and reports**.  
- Build modular, production-ready tools that can integrate with existing security workflows.
