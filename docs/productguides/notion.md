# Notion for Beginners

## What to Know Before You Start

THis guide is for beginners.

Notion is a tool for writing, planning, and organizing.

Everything in Notion is made of blocks > text, checklists, images, or tables : that you can move and arrange however you like.

Think of it as a blank notebook that can grow into a planner, a wiki, or even a full project hub.

## Introduction

Notion isn’t just another note taking app , it’s a **workspace where notes, tasks, and projects live together**.
Think of it as a second brain: you write things down once, and they’re always there when you need them.

 Notion helps you turn **chaos turns into clarity**. Instead of sticky notes and scattered apps, everything lives in one place.


## Step 1: Create Your First Page

When you open Notion, you start with a blank page.
This page can be text, images, tasks, or even databases.

A Notion page is  a **canvas** for artists only this time you are the artist. 

## Step 2: Add Blocks

In Notion, everything is a block  a paragraph, a checklist, a heading, an image.
Type `/` to see all block options.

Examples:

* `/todo` for checklists
* `/h1` for headings
* `/table` for databases


## Step 3: Create a Task List

Type `/todo` and start listing tasks.
Add checkboxes and mark them complete when done.

 Every checkmark is proof of movement.

## Step 4: Use Databases

Databases are what make Notion different from a simple notes app.
They can be a table, a Kanban board, a calendar, or a gallery.

Examples:

* Table for expenses
* Kanban board for projects
* Calendar for deadlines

A database is a **library**. You don’t just collect data , you connect it.



## Step 5: Link and Nest Pages

In Notion, pages can live inside other pages.
You can also link one page to another for quick navigation.


## Step 6: Collaboration

Invite friends, classmates, or teammates to your workspace.
Assign tasks, leave comments, and work together in real time.

Collaboration in Notion is like **writing in the same notebook at once**  everyone’s ideas stay in context.



## Best Practices for Beginners

* Start small > one page for notes, one page for tasks.
* Use templates > Notion has built-in ones for projects, journals, and wikis.
* Keep it clean > don’t overcomplicate until you’re comfortable.
