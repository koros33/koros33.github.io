# Product Guides

Welcome to the **Product Guides** section of my documentation portfolio.  
Here, Iâ€™ve created clear and practical guides for popular tools and formats.  
Each guide is written to help users get started quickly, understand the essentials, and explore best practices.  

## Available Guides

- [Git](git.md) > Version control basics, workflows, and collaboration tips.  
- [Notion](notion.md) > Organizing workspaces, databases, and documentation.  
- [Slack](slack.md) > Communication, integrations, and productivity features.  
- [Markdown](markdown.md) > Writing clean, structured text with formatting.  
- [Whitepaper](whitepaper.md) > Structuring and writing professional technical papers.
- [Postman](postman.md) > Testing APIS to help me create documentation.  


This section will grow as I add more tools and examples of my documentation work.
