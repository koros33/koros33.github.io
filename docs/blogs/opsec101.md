# OPSEC 101: A Beginner's Guide for Non-Technical Users

Operational Security, or **OPSEC**, is all about protecting yourself and your sensitive information from being exposed—both online and offline. While it’s a concept often discussed in cybersecurity circles, you don’t need to be a tech expert to start practicing good OPSEC.  

In this guide, we’ll break down OPSEC into **simple steps** anyone can follow.


## 1. Be Mindful of What You Share

Every day, we share bits of information online—sometimes without realizing the risks.  
- Avoid posting sensitive details like your **home address, phone number, or travel plans** publicly.  
- Be cautious with social media check-ins. Even seemingly harmless photos can reveal personal routines.  
- Think twice before sharing personal opinions or conflicts online; these can be exploited for social engineering.

**Tip:** Ask yourself, “Could someone use this information to target me?”


## 2. Use Strong, Unique Passwords

Passwords are your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to gain access to your accounts.  
- Use a mix of **letters, numbers, and symbols**.  
- Never reuse passwords across multiple platforms.  
- Consider using a **password manager** to generate and store strong passwords securely.


## 3. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA adds an extra layer of protection beyond just a password. Even if someone guesses your password, they won’t get in without the second factor.  
- Use **authenticator apps** like Google Authenticator or Authy.  
- Avoid SMS-based 2FA if possible, as it can be intercepted.


## 4. Keep Software Up to Date

Software updates aren’t just annoying pop-ups—they patch vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.  
- Always update your **operating system, apps, and antivirus software**.  
- Enable automatic updates whenever possible.


## 5. Be Careful with Emails and Links

Phishing is one of the easiest ways for attackers to trick you into giving away information.  
- Never click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.  
- Verify URLs before entering login information.  
- Look for signs of phishing, like **urgent language, typos, or unfamiliar sender addresses**.


## 6. Protect Your Devices

Physical security matters just as much as digital security.  
- Lock your devices with strong passwords or biometrics.  
- Avoid leaving devices unattended in public spaces.  
- Use encrypted storage for sensitive files if needed.


## 7. Understand Your Digital Footprint

Everything you post, like, or share contributes to your **digital footprint**.  
- Regularly review privacy settings on social media.  
- Be aware of what apps you authorize to access your data.  
- Remove old accounts you no longer use.


## Final Thoughts

OPSEC doesn’t have to be complicated. By being aware of what you share, protecting your accounts, and staying vigilant, you can significantly reduce your risk of being targeted.  
Remember: **security starts with good habits**, not fancy tools.


**Next Steps:**  
Try implementing **one OPSEC habit per week**. Over time, these small actions build a strong personal security foundation—even if you’re not technical.
