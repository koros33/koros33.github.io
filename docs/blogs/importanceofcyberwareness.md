###  Why Cybersecurity Awareness Matters

In 2025, almost everything we do from studying and working to paying bills  happens online.
But as technology grows, so do the tricks cybercriminals use to steal our information.

That’s why **cybersecurity awareness** is not just for IT experts  it’s for everyone.

Here are simple ways to protect yourself and others.


###  1. Use Strong Passwords (and Don’t Reuse Them)

Weak passwords are still one of the biggest risks.
A good password should be **at least 12 characters**, with numbers, symbols, and mixed cases.

Use a **password manager** like Bitwarden or 1Password to keep track securely.


###  2. Turn On Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Even if someone gets your password, 2FA stops them from logging in.
Always enable 2FA for your **email, banking, and social media** accounts.


###  3. Think Before You Click

Phishing emails and fake links are everywhere.
Before clicking a link or downloading an attachment, **check the sender’s address** and **hover over links** to see where they lead.

If it feels suspicious  it probably is.


###  4. Update Everything

Updates often fix security holes that hackers exploit.
Keep your **Windows, Android, or iPhone**, and even **apps** up to date.


###  5. Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Work

Free Wi-Fi in cafes or matatus sounds convenient  but it’s risky.
If you must use it, connect through a **VPN** to encrypt your connection.



###  6. Stay Informed

Cyber threats evolve fast.
Follow cybersecurity pages, podcasts, or creators who simplify complex topics  that’s how you stay ahead.

You can even start a **cyber awareness club or blog** in your school or community.


###  Final Thoughts

Cybersecurity awareness starts with small daily habits  not expensive tools.
Protecting your data means protecting your identity, your money, and your peace of mind.

If you found this helpful, share it  awareness is our first line of defense.
