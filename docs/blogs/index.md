# Welcome to the Library

Think of this blog as a library:  
- The **Documentation Shelf** holds lessons on clarity and writing.  
- The **Code Shelf** hides experiments in Python, web, and automation.  
- The **Stories Shelf** carries running journeys and client tales.  

Every time you visit, youâ€™re opening a book from my thoughts.
