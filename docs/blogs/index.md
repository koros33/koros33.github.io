# Welcome to the Library

Think of this blog as a library:  
- The **Documentation Shelf** holds lessons on clarity and writing.  
- The **Code Shelf** hides experiments in Python, web, and automation.  
- The **Stories Shelf** carries running journeys and client tales.
- I try to keep a **conversational story** tone in these blogs.

Every time you visit, you’re opening a book from my thoughts.
