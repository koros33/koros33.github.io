# About Me

> Docs should be like good coffee: strong, clear, and impossible to ignore.   

I’m Koros Ian, a technical writer with a background in journalism and writing.  
I craft **API docs, user manuals, onboarding guides, and FAQs** that help your users succeed without rage clicking.  

- Markdown + Git = my happy place   
- Postman + cURL = my API playground   
- Notion + Confluence = my collaboration toolkit
- openAPI + swagger.  

Currently exploring the intersection of **SaaS, DevTools, and AI** and backend engineering.


> Open to **remote roles & internships** where I can put my documentation skills to work.
