# About Me

> Docs should be like good coffee: strong, clear, and impossible to ignore. ☕  

I’m [Your Name], a technical writer with a background in journalism.  
I craft **API docs, user manuals, onboarding guides, and FAQs** that help your users succeed without rage clicking.  

- Markdown + Git = my happy place 🛠️  
- Postman + cURL = my API playground 🌐  
- Notion + Confluence = my collaboration toolkit 💡  

Currently exploring the intersection of **SaaS, DevTools, and AI** — and open to **remote roles & internships** where I can put my documentation skills to work.
