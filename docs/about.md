# About Me


I’m **Koros Ian**, a technical writer with a background in journalism. I see documentation as more than instructions , it’s turning complexity into clarity so users don’t rage-click their way into frustration.

My toolkit:

* **Markdown + Git** → my blueprints
* **Postman + cURL** → my lab
* **Notion + Confluence** → my commons
* **OpenAPI + Swagger** → my compass
* 
"I’m currently documenting a **Payments API with spotlight sudio** and **open source contribution** focusing on making the docs as straightforward and usable as the API itself."


Docs should be like good coffee: **strong, clear, and impossible to ignore**.

I believe good docs don’t just explain software  they build trust.

Open to **remote roles & internships** where I can put this philosophy into practice.
